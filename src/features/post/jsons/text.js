I think the biggest mismatch problem in this series for Atlanta is Khris Middleton who played like hot garbage in game 1.  The only guy who can realistically guard him is Solomon Hill, but he's useless offensively. If I was Bud, I'd match Solomon Hill's minutes exactly with Bryn Forbes so that there was a place to hide Forbes on defense (That dude makes Trae look like Gary Payton) while making your guards defend him on the offensive end.  If Hunter was playing, that would solve those issues completely IMO.",

I think the biggest mismatch problem in this series for Atlanta is Khris Middleton who played like hot garbage in game 1.  The only guy who can realistically guard him is Solomon Hill, but he&amp;#39;s useless offensively. If I was Bud, I&amp;#39;d match Solomon Hill&amp;#39;s minutes exactly with Bryn Forbes so that there was a place to hide Forbes on defense (That dude makes Trae look like Gary Payton) while making your guards defend him on the offensive end.  If Hunter was playing, that would solve those issues completely IMO.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
